CVE-2020-24586,Medium,Medium,http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2020-24586,The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA  WPA2  and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that received fragments be cleared from memory after (re)connecting to a network. Under the right circumstances  when another device sends fragmented frames encrypted using WEP  CCMP  or GCMP  this can be abused to inject arbitrary network packets and/or exfiltrate user data. Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel’s WiFi implementation did not properly clear received fragments from memory in some situations. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this issue to inject packets or expose sensitive information.,CVE-2020-24586 on Ubuntu 20.04 (focal) - medium.,5.11.0-1009.9~20.04.2,linux-aws,false
